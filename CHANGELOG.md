## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0] - 2026-08-04

First stable release. No code changes since `v0.1.0-alpha-2`; the tag aligns
this agent with the CoStaff v0.1.0 ecosystem release so
`costaff update --all --tag v0.1.0` resolves here too.

## [0.1.0-alpha-2] - 2026-06-14

### Changed

- Upgraded `google-adk` 2.0.0 → 2.1.0.
- Version bumped to `0.1.0-alpha-2`.

## [0.1.0-alpha-1] - 2026-05-27

First tagged pre-release. Scaffold template for new CoStaff agents — agent + MCP companion + Dockerfile + tests skeleton.

### Added

- `agent.__version__` constant for deploy verification.
- `CHANGELOG.md` (this file).

### Changed

- `costaff.agent.json` version bumped to `0.1.0-alpha-1` (was `1.0.0`).
